\begin{abstract}
    This is a set of solutions for the problem sets in Math 231a, taught in the fall of 2023 by Dr. Hana Jia Kong at Harvard. Most of the problems are taken from May's \emph{A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology,} otherwise it is specified in the problem statement. Some of the solutions also contain light expository materials on related topics, so I recommend going through these solutions even if you have already solved the problem set. As a result of this being a solution manual, some of the solutions are significantly more lengthy than required, and your solutions do not have to be this long to receive full credit.
