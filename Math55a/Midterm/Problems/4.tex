\begin{problem}
Let $\phi:V\to W$ be a linear map of vector spaces over a field $k$. Show that if $\Ker(\phi)$ and $\Ima(\phi)$ are both finite-dimensional then $V$ is finite-dimensional.
\end{problem}

By the first isomorphism theorem, we have an isomorphism $\widetilde{\phi} : V /\Ker(\phi) \to \Ima(\phi)$. Thus $V/\Ker(\phi)$ is finite dimensional, since it is isomorphic to a finite dimensional space. Now suppose for the sake of contradiction that $V$ was infinite dimensional with basis $\{v_i\}_{i\in I}$. Suppose $w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n$ is a basis for $\Ker(\phi)$. Now write out each $w_i$ as a finite linear combination of $v_j$. Let $\Omega\subset \{v_i\}_{i\in I}$ be the set of $v_j$ that appear in a linear combination for any of the $w_i$. Note that since there are a finite number of $w_i$ and each one is expressed as a finite linear combination of $v_j$, $\Omega$ is a finite set. Then $V/\mathrm{span}(\Omega)\subset V/\mathrm{Ker}(\phi)$, since $\Ker(\phi)\subset \mathrm{span}(\Omega)$. Note that $V/\mathrm{span}(\Omega)\cong \mathrm{span}(\{v_i\}_{i\in I}-\Omega)$, which is infinite dimensional since $\Omega$ is finite. So we have a contradiction because there is an infinite dimensional subspace of a finite dimensional space. So $V$ cannot be infinite dimensional.
