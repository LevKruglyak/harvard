\begin{problem}
Suppose the rows of an $n\times n$ real matrix $A\in M_n(\R)$ form an orthonormal basis for $\R^n$ with its usual inner product. Show that the same is true of the columns of $A$.
\end{problem}

\textit{(We will assume things proven in class)}

The rows of $A$ are orthonormal so the columns of $A^\intercal$ are orthonormal. This means that $A^\intercal$ is an orthogonal matrix, and so $(A^\intercal)^\intercal A^\intercal = AA^\intercal = I$. Since $A$ is an orthogonal operator, it is invertible, so $A^{\intercal}=A^{-1}$ and $A^{\intercal}A=I$. So $A$ is an orthogonal operator so the columns of $A$ form an orthonormal basis.
