\begin{problem}
  Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces of dimensions $m$ and $n$, with $n \geq m$. Show that every element $\phi \in V \otimes W$ has rank at most $m$; that is, it is expressible as a sum of $m$ or fewer pure tensors. If $U$, $V$ and $W$ are three finite-dimensional vector spaces, can you bound the rank of elements of the triple tensor product 
  $U \otimes V \otimes W$?
