\begin{problem}
Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Show that $R$ is in fact a field if and only if every finitely generated $R$-module is free. 
\end{problem}
\textit{(Hint: if $a\neq 0$ is not invertible, consider $R/aR$, the quotient of $R$
by the subgroup $aR=\{ar,\ r\in R\}$; check that it is an $R$-module, and study its properties.)}
