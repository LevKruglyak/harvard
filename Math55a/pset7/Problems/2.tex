\begin{problem}
Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $K$. Recall that we have a natural linear \emph{contraction map} $\kappa : V^* \otimes V \to K$ sending $\ell \otimes v \in V^* \otimes V$ to $\ell(v)$. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Show that, under the identification  $V^* \otimes V = \Hom(V,V) = \End(V)$, this is simply the \emph{trace}: that is, given a linear map $T : V \to V$, $\kappa(T)$ is the sum of the diagonal entries of any matrix representative of $T$.
  \item Show that the map  $b : \End(V) \times \End(V) \to K$ which sends $(S,T)$ to the trace of the composition $S \circ T$ is bilinear and symmetric. \textit{(Try to do this in a ``coordinate-free'' manner, without introducing matrices)}
  \item For which $n$ do there exist endomorphisms $S, T$ of an $n$-dimensional vector space such that $ST - TS = id$ is the identity?
\end{enumerate}
