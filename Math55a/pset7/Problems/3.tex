\begin{problem}
Let $V=\R^n$, and $\End(V)=M_n(\R)$ the space of $n\times n$ real matrices. The symmetric bilinear form considered in the previous problem is now explicitly the bilinear map $b:M_n(\R)\times M_n(\R)\to\R$ given by $b(M,N)=tr(MN)$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Show that the symmetric bilinear form $b$ is non-degenerate.
  \textit{(Hint: what is $b(M,M^T)$?)}
  \item Find a pair of subspaces $W_\pm\subset M_n(\R)$ such that
  \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item $M_n(\R)=W_+\oplus W_-$,
    \item $W_+$ and $W_-$ are orthogonal to each other for
    $b$,
    \item the restriction $b$ to $W_+$, resp.\ $W_-$, is definite 
    positive, resp.\ definite negative.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
What is the {\em signature} $(\dim W_+,\dim W_-)$ of the symmetric bilinear form $b$?
