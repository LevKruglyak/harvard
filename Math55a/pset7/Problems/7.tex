\begin{problem}
Show by giving an example over the ring $R = k[x,y]$ of polynomials in two variables that, again in contrast to the case of vector spaces over a field, a submodule of a free module need not be free.
\end{problem}

Let $R = k[x,y]$ be an $R$-module, so it trivially is a free $R$-module of rank $1$. Consider the submodule $M\subset R$ which consists of all polynomials with no constant term. This is a submodule clearly closed under add
