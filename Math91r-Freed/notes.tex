\section*{Distributions and Foliations}

Throughout, let $M$ be a smooth manifold of fixed dimension $n$.

\begin{definition}
  A \defn{distribution} on $M$ is a subbundle $E\subset TM$ of the tangent bundle of $M$. We'll denote the set of all distributions of rank $k$ on $M$ by $\mathscr{D}^k(M)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A submanifold $N\subset M$ is said to be an \defn{integral manifold} to a distribution $E\in \mathscr{D}^k(M)$ if for every $p\in N$, we have $T_p N = E_p$, both considered as subset of $T_p M$.
\end{definition}

In general, we want to investigate some existence conditions for integral manifolds associated to a foliation, we begin with the simplest case; flat Euclidean space.

\subsection*{Integral Manifolds on $\E^k$}

Suppose first that $E$ is a rank one distribution on $\E^k$.
